If you have launched your site with WooCommerce and you want to sell downloadable products with that, you will have a major problem with downloadable products. The problem is that if you update the WooCommerce product downloadable file or add a new file to the files list, your user will not be able to see the download link of the new file and will still see the download links they received when they purchased. With this plugin, you can update WooCommerce product download links for the previous orders.

This plugin grants downloads permissions like WooCommerce 2.6.x, granting permissions for new files added to a downloadable product. Note that this plugin performs heavy database queries and does not scale. For this reason it has been removed from WooCommerce core.

> Note: This plugin is a copy of the [WooCommerce repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/grant-download-permissions-for-past-woocommerce-orders) on GitHub.
